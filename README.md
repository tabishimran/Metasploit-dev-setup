# Metasploit-dev-setup
Bash script to setup metasploit development environment


## Installation

 - `bash setup.sh` 
 -  or `chmod +x setup.sh` and `./setup.sh`

## Found a bug? 
Right now, I have only tested this on an ubuntu 14.04 VM and an ubuntu 16.10 VM , should work fine on other 
distros too. I will try to test this on a couple of other machines just to be sure.
Feel free to register an 'issue' on this repository, I'll try my best to resolve it.
